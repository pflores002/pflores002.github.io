        <h1>Resume</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> My objective is to become an animator and create shows
        or visual effects for future movies. </p>
        <p> I live in Palm Desert, CA and I am currently studying at Palm Desert
        High School. I have been studying at Palm Desert High School for almost 4 years and
        I have enrolled into courses such as computer science, art, and film. There are multiple
        colleges that I wish to attend such as California State University- Fullerton,
        California State University- Long Beach, Savannah College of Art and Design,
        Laguna College of Art and Design, Academy of Art University, and CalArts. All of which I
        am interested in their animation prograpms as a major and, for the CSU colleges, astronomy
        as a minor. </p>
        <p> A work experience that I have had was mainly in film, I assisted my friends in their series,
        Under the Waves, in which I got to work with the camera. I also edited a horror film that we
        recorded at the Coachella Valley Movie Ranch as well as storyboarded the film. </p>
        <p> In my years of high school I have achieved two certificates for Principal's Honor Roll
        in 2017 and 2018, which is given to those with a 3.0 GPA or higher. I enrolled in many
        honors and AP classes over the years, but currently I am taking AP Literature and Composition
        and AP Studio Art. I used to be enrolled in honors Spanish and I am fairly fluent in the
        language- mostly I am able to understand words,not quite able to speak it. I am also enrolled
        in film, and I would edit and storyboard films though recently I have had the chance to be
        a director and screenwrite a film. In addition to film, I am also in art. I draw traditionally
        with a pencil, but I have explored other mediums such as charcoal, and painted with oil and
        acryllic. I also draw digitally with Adobe Sketch.</p>
