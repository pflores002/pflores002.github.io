        <p>My dream is to become an animator. I plan to
        achieve this career by studying the methods of both past and recent animators.
        I plan to go to college with this career in mind as my major so I can learn new ways
        to animate, from traditional to 3D. The reason I chose to become an animator is because it
        was the perfect balance between two of my favorite pasttimes during middle school:
        drawing and writing. I used to write simple poems and short stories and at that point, I
        thought I could become an author. But I did not want to abandon my love for drawing, so then
        next best thing was becoming an illustrator. That did not seem to satisfy me either because
        I still wanted to be able to create stories. At last, the idea of animation came to me when my
        parents and I spent a night watching Disney Pizar's Wall-E,
        and at that moment I know that animation was going to be the perfect career for me.</p>

        <p>I am naturally artistic and I am able to adapt to new mediums of art. I am known to be creative
        and cooperative towards others, including students, teachers, and coworkers. I have worked mainly
        on traditional art including oil, pencil, charcoal, and many others. But currently, I am practicing digitally, and I
        am learning new platforms such as Adobe.</p>

        <p>I have joined a total of three AP courses and two Honors courses throughout the 4
        years I've been in Palm Desert High School. I have also taken electives such as Computer Science Principles,
        AP Studio Art, and Film and Broadcasting. Through the experiences I have gained in high school,
        I have learned to be self-motivated and supportive of my peers as well as become patient and responsible. </p>

        <p>Through experience, I have learned to adapt and I have learned throughout my interests and strengths to
        gain knowledge what I want to become in my future. Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and feel
        free to explore the rest of my website.</p>
